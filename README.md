# Racial Bias Analysis

## For a recruiter, student, or anyone reading: you're likely wondering... what is COMPAS?

Well, it is short for "Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions". As described by wikipedia, it is a case management and decision support tool developed and owned by Northpointe (now Equivant) used by U.S. courts to assess the likelihood of a defendant becoming a recidivist.

It is interesting, because a non-profit organization known as "Propublica", actually found that it discriminates against black defendants. In this project, inspired by a project in a popular course at the University known as "Safe and Ethical AI", we will be using a dataset of COMPAS scores to see if Propublica was correct in their analysis.
